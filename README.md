# mDNSWindows

mDNSWindows is a fork of Apple's mDNSResponder code to improve and maintain
Windows support. See [APPLE_README.txt](./APPLE_README.txt) for the original
README that accompanied this project.

Most of the files in this repository are verbatim as they appeared in the
tarball version 878.70.2 obtained from Apple's
[download page](https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder/). Files
and projects not relevant to mDNS/DNS-SD support on Windows have been removed.
Legacy build projects have been removed and replaced with a CMake system. Any
source files modified by ETC contain comments at the top of the file describing
the modification.
